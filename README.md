## Features
All stable releases starting with 3.0.7.0 on this fork are signed with the ME3Tweaks code signing certificate.

Some highlights of features that were developed on this fork:
 - Jumplists in the taskbar allow you to right click to open tools
 - Many quality of life improvements in the UI, such as pressing enter to submit, opening files in other tools directly from tools themselves, smart recents menus
 - Package Editor has property relinking when drag/dropping between files for the entire tree. This saves a HUGE amount of time for users compared to the old manual way.
 - You can view Bio2DA tables natively in Bio2DA editor view in Package Editor.
 - You can edit levels using Pathfinding Editor, including placement of objects, pathfinding, and spline movement and recalculation of reparam tables
 - WPF rewrites of multiple tools to use a more modern design language - better DPI scaling, more features. These include PackageEditorWPF (and its contents), and SoundplorerWPF, with more on the way. All of these tools are being completely rewritten.
 - Many more not listed here
  
You can get these releases in ME3Tweaks Mod Manager's Tools menu, or you can download from the releases tab above. Come to the ME3Tweaks Discord to talk with the developers. You can download nightlies from within Mod Manager as well.
